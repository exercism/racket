You can download the latest Racket installer from [the official Racket website](https://download.racket-lang.org/).  Installers are available for Windows (64-bit and 32-bit), macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) and Linux (64-bit).

If you prefer to use a package manager, like `brew` on MacOS, `winget` on Windows or your Linux distribution's package manager, see [the Racket Wiki](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Installing-Racket) for more detailed instructions.
