## About the Linux installer:
The Linux build is generic enough that it should work on most distributions, including relatively old distributions. 

After downloading the installer file, run it with
```
sh racket-8.10-x86_64-linux-cs.sh
```

You may need to prefix `sudo` to the start of the command to install to a location that requires administrator access.

**Warning: Racket may also be available through your distribution's package manager, although it may be older than the latest Racket version.** While you may choose to do this later, as a learner you will have a much better experience if you stick to the current release available from https://download.racket-lang.org


## About the macOS installer:

If your machine uses the M1 or M2 series processors, select **Apple Silicon** in the platform dropdown menu before downloading.
