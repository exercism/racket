# About

"Racket (formerly named PLT Scheme) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research." - [Wikipedia][wikipedia racket page]

You can learn the basics of Racket through a few different books.  Start by checking out [*How to Design Programs*][htdp], make your own games with the slightly less formal but enjoyable [*Realm of Racket*][realm], or explore Racket's diverse libraries with [*Racket Programming the Fun Way*][the fun way].

Check out the [official language website][racket homepage] and the [Github repository][racket github].  You can find the community on [Twitter][racket twitter], [mailing lists][racket listserv], [Discord][racket discord] and [Slack][racket slack].
