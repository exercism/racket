## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests should be focused on a single exercise, issue, or conceptually cohesive change. Please refer to Exercism's [pull request guidelines](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/pull-request-guidelines.md). If you plan to make significant or breaking changes, please open an issue so we can discuss it first.

Prior to submitting a pull request, ensure that your test requires the stub file, and not the example file - like so:

```Racket
#lang racket/base

(require "perfect-numbers.rkt")

(module+ test
  (require rackunit rackunit/text-ui)

  (define suite
    (test-suite
     "perfect numbers tests"

     (test-equal? "no perfect numbers in 1 - 5"
                  (perfect-numbers 5)
                  '())))

  (run-tests suite))
```
