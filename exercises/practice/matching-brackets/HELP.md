## Running the tests

To run the test through DrRacket, simply open the test file and click the 'Run' button in the upper right.

To run the test from the command line, run the test from the exercise directory with the following command:

```
raco test <exercise>-test.rkt
```

where `<exercise>` should be replaced with the exercise's slug.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit grains.rkt` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
