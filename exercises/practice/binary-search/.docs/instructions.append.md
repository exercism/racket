# Instructions append

In Racket, this exercise uses sorted [vectors] rather than lists because vectors support constant-time access of its elements. Like several other Lisp tracks, when an item isn't present in the vector, the expectation is that the [Boolean literal `#f`][booleans] will be returned rather than raising an exception.
