## Functions and testing

The starting code you're provided with,
```scheme
(provide hello)

(define (hello)
  "Goodbye, Mars!")
```
defines a function named `hello` and makes it available to run.
The test runner takes this function and runs it, comparing the value it returns to the value it expects.
Use this starting function definition as the basis for your solution.
